InvestHub  

Overview
InvestHub is a unified financial management app that allows users to track, compare, and invest in mutual funds (MFs) and stocks from multiple platforms—all in one place. With AI-driven insights, a user-friendly interface, and one-click execution, this app simplifies investment decisions for both beginners and experienced investors.

Key Features

1. Automatic Portfolio Tracking

Fetches data from MF Central API and broker APIs.

Displays all investments with execution links (e.g., "Buy more" button for funds)

Works like PhonePe for bank balances, but for stocks and mutual funds

2. Smart AI-Powered Comparison and Recommendation Tool

Uses AI/ML to recommend better-performing funds and stocks

Provides simple visual indicators such as:

Trust Score (star ratings similar to ride-sharing apps)

Risk Meter (Low, Medium, High)

Projected Returns (e.g., "10,000 to 12,000 in 1 year")

Example: “Fund A is better than Fund B: 15 percent returns with same risk. Switch now?”

Also suggests similar or better-performing alternatives based on portfolio analysis

3. One Dashboard for Tracking and Execution

View all mutual funds and stocks in a single interactive dashboard

One-click execution through "Invest Now" button

Eliminates the need to log in separately to MF Central or broker platforms

4. Simple and Interactive User Interface

One-click actions for comparing funds and executing investments

Fund and stock comparisons function similar to product comparisons in e-commerce apps

Includes real-time updates, filters, and sorting for better analysis
